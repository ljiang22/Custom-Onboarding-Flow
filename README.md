# Custom-Onboarding-Flow
The goal of the project is to create a custom onboarding flow for users. Admins of the app (perhaps non-technical) should be able to customize the user onboarding flow. Several fields that are to be collected are known. But the team would like to be able to easily change the page that these fields appear on, perhaps for A/B testing, etc.
